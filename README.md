This is the Getting Started app that can be found in the [steeplejack documentation](http://steeplejack.info/docs/getting-started/)

# Running

You need to have a working instance of NodeJS on your machine.  Once you have that, then it's simply a case of:

    npm install
    npm start

Once that's started, you should see:

    Server started on port 3000
